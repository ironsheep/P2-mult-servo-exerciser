## The Rotary Encoder object PUBLIC Interface

The object **isp\_quadEncWBtn_sp.spin2.spin2** when first started fires a separate monitoring task in a Spin Cog. When you read the values you are reading the latest stored values written by the monitoring task. 
The object provides the following methods:

| Steering Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  **>--- CONTROL**
| <PRE>PUB start(pnEnc0, pnEnc1, pnBtn)</PRE> | Start the sensing Cog using the given pins 
| <PRE>PUB stop()</PRE> | Stop the sensing Cog, clear and float the pins used.
|  **>--- SENSING**
| <PRE>PUB isButtonPressed() : bIsPressed, bIsDouble</PRE> | Return {bIsPressed} - T/F where T means button was pressed </br> and {bIsDouble} - T/F where T means the press was a double press |
| <PRE>positionRate() : currPosn, currRate</PRE> | Return {currPosn} the current quadEncoder position N where N=[-n < 0 < n] </br> and {currRate} the current quadEncoder steps since last rotation N where N=[0-n] |
| <PRE>rate() : currRate</PRE> | Return {currPosn} the current quadEncoder position N where N=[-n < 0 < n] |
| <PRE>position() : currPosn</PRE> | Return {currRate} the current quadEncoder steps since last rotation N where N=[0-n] |

**NOTE:** this object uses 4 smart pins for the quad position decoding.  Two connected to the rotary encoder track current position, while two additional pins (at lower pin number -1 -and -2, connected to the same two inputs) which track the velocity of the rotation. The 5th pin then senses the button press events.
