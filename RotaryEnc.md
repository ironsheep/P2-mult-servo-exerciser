# P2 Rotary Encoder Spin2 Object
A reusable object written in spin2 for reading the rotary encoder with the push button feature. This object features reading of rotation distance and velocity while the button press logic detects single and double-clicks.

## The Hardware

This object support the standard Parallax Rotary Encoder.

</p>

This device is connected by 3 signal wires, Vcc and ground.

The driver runs a task in a single Cog which continuously monitors the rotation and button presses.  The driver provides the following readings from the attached hardware:

- Rotational distance
- Rotational Scaled distance (*distance x velocity x scale value*)
- Rotational velocity
- Button presses
- For each button press, if it is a single our double-press

## The Rotary Encoder object PUBLIC Interface

The object **isp\_quadEncWBtn_sp.spin2** when first started fires a separate monitoring task in a Spin Cog. When you read the values you are reading the latest stored values written by the monitoring task. 
The object provides the following methods for starting up, tearing down and accessing the values read from the device:

| OBJECT Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  **>--- CONTROL**
| <PRE>PUB start(pnEnc0, pnEnc1, pnBtn)</PRE> | Start the sensing Cog using the given pins 
| <PRE>PUB stop()</PRE> | Stop the sensing Cog, clear and float the pins used.
| <PRE>PUB setScale(scaleValue)</PRE> | Set encoder distance scaling to {scaleValue}  [Default: 4]
| <PRE>PUB getScale() : scaleValue</PRE> | Return encoder distance {scaleValue}
|  **>--- SENSING**
| <PRE>PUB isButtonPressed() : bIsPressed, bIsDouble</PRE> | Return {bIsPressed} - T/F where T means button was pressed </br> and {bIsDouble} - T/F where T means the press was a double press |
| <PRE>PUB position() : currPosn</PRE> | Return {currRate} the current quadEncoder steps since last rotation N where N=[0-n] |
| <PRE>PUB positionScaled() : currScaledPosn</PRE> | Return scaled value for current quadEncoder position N where N=[-n < 0 < n]</br>AFFECTED BY: setScale(scaleValue)|
| <PRE>PUB rate() : currRate</PRE> | Return {currPosn} the current quadEncoder position N where N=[-n < 0 < n] |
| <PRE>PUB positionRate() : currPosn, currRate</PRE> | Return {currPosn} the current quadEncoder position N where N=[-n < 0 < n] </br> and {currRate} the current quadEncoder steps since last rotation N where N=[0-n] |

**NOTE:** this object uses 4 smart pins for the quad position decoding.  Two connected to the rotary encoder which track current position, while two additional pins (at lower pin number -1 -and -2, are connected to the same two inputs) which track the velocity of the rotation. The 5th pin then senses the button press events.
