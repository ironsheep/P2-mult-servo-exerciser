## Exerciser with OLED display and Rotary Encoder for control

Most of us playing with servos in our projects have a single servo tester:

</p>

But when we are using a 16-channel PWM controller driving our servos we can either unplug each servo to test it or we can do something like this project! 

I grabbed a TIMI-130 serial attached OLED display and a rotary encoder with pushbutton feature as be my interface and I used code I already had for the PCA9685 controller.  

I then wrote a driver for the encoder which provided distance and velocity for the turning part a single, double-click for the push button part. [See RotaryEncoder page](./RotaryEnc.md)

Then I created a single TIMI interface object by porting the python TIMI library. Now I can drive the display. [See TIMI Displays page](./TIMI.md)

In the end my cobbled together tester looks like this:

</p>

And this is the tester connected to the back of the 6-servo hardware I'm characterizing:

Lastly, this is the output from the tester:

### Features

To use this exercisor simply connect to the PCA9685 i2c bus and run the project.

- Steps through each of the servos from 0-15
- Cycles LO and HI for each servo
- Reminds which end of the range is currently being tested
- Emits (via debug_ the final LO, HI values for each servo tested.

Enjoy!
