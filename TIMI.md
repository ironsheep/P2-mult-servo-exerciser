[Breadboard Mates (BBM)](https://breadboardmates.com/) produces the TIMI line of displays. These are similar to teh Nextion devices we've seen in that we select the screens to be displayed and upload them to the device (essentially flashing the device.) Then we connect the device containing the screens to our project via serial and simply send values to the screen fields or labels.
